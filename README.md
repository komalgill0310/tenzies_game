# Tenzies Game

## Overview

Welcome to the **"Tenzies Game"** ‚Äì a React project built to enhance my skills in developing React applications. This game involves 10 dice, allowing users to hold dice with the same number. Once the user clicks on a die, the timer starts in the background. The game displays the number of rolls it took the user to win, the time taken to win, and the best time so far. After completing the game, confetti falls on the screen for a festive celebration. Users can start a new game and roll the held dice using the "Rolls" button. Previous game records are stored in local storage for future reference.
